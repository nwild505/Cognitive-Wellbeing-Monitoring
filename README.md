# 🧠 Cognitive Wellbeing Monitoring

## 🌍 Project Overview
This project analyzes global mental health trends using DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) data for mental disorders. It leverages machine learning to forecast future trends, identify high-risk countries, and generate visual insights to support data-driven decision-making for policymakers, researchers, and advocacy groups.

## ❗ Problem Statement
Mental health is a growing global concern, yet many regions lack predictive tools to anticipate future burdens. Policymakers and healthcare organizations require robust analytics to allocate resources, plan interventions, and prioritize high-risk populations. This project addresses that gap by applying ML-based forecasting and classification to cognitive wellbeing data across countries.

## 🔍 Project Description
- 📈 **Regression Model**: Predicts DALY percentages for each country over the next 5 years.
- 🚨 **Classification Model**: Flags high-risk countries and years based on DALY thresholds.
- 📊 **Visualizations**:
  - Line charts for historical and forecasted DALY trends
  - Bar charts summarizing high-risk proportions
  - Interactive world maps showing global DALY distribution
  - SHAP plots for model interpretability

## 👥 End Users
- Government health departments and policymakers
- Healthcare organizations and global health researchers
- NGOs and mental health advocacy groups
- Data scientists exploring predictive health analytics
